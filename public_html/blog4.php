                        <p class="infotext">IGO Agritechfarms, a india's leading agricultural technology company,
                            recently provided an industrial Visit opportunity to students of JNN Institute of
                            Engineering. The program was focused on the topic of polyhouse farming, and IGO Agritech's
                            staff explained various aspects of this farming technique to the students.</p>
                        <p>Polyhouse farming is a modern technique of agriculture that involves growing plants in a
                            controlled environment, usually within a greenhouse-like structure made of transparent
                            material. This type of farming is gaining popularity in recent times, as it provides several
                            advantages over traditional farming methods. Polyhouse farming enables farmers to grow crops
                            throughout the year, irrespective of the season and climate, by providing a suitable
                            environment for the plants.</p>

                <p>During the industrial Visit, the students were introduced to the different types of polyhouse
                            structures and materials used in their construction. The IGO Agritech staff also explained
                            the various components of a polyhouse, such as the ventilation system, irrigation system,
                            and climate control mechanisms, and their importance in maintaining the ideal environment
                            for the plants.</p>

                    <div class="projectinfo">
                        <p class="infotext">The students were also given hands-on training on how to prepare the soil
                            for polyhouse farming, how to plant and care for different crops, and how to use various
                            tools and equipment used in polyhouse farming. The IGO Agritech team also demonstrated the
                            use of various technologies and software tools used in managing a polyhouse farm, such as
                            sensors, automatic irrigation systems, and climate control software.</p>
                        <p>The internship program provided the students with an excellent opportunity to gain practical
                            experience and exposure to modern farming techniques. The students were able to apply the
                            theoretical knowledge gained from their engineering courses to the practical aspects of
                            polyhouse farming. The program also gave them a glimpse into the future of agriculture,
                            which is likely to be dominated by technology-driven solutions like polyhouse farming.</p>

                        Institute of Engineering students on the topic of polyhouse farming was an excellent
                        initiative that helped the students gain practical knowledge and experience in modern
                        agriculture. The program also helped in bridging the gap between academia and industry,
                        providing a win-win situation for both the students and the company.And we provide
