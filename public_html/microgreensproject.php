                        <p>Microgreens are young, tender edible seedlings of vegetables and herbs harvested at 7–21 days after
                            germination. They are nutrient-dense, rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, making them a
                            “superfood” category product. With increasing awareness of health and nutrition, microgreens have
                            become a high-demand product among urban consumers, restaurants, and wellness industries.
                            This project aims to establish a commercial microgreen cultivation unit under a controlled
                            rooftop/indoor environment, supported by a Setup, buyback & AMC service model. The objective is
                            to provide clients with an end-to-end cultivation setup, training, and marketing support while ensuring
                            product quality and profitability. </p>
